### Project Guidelines

----

- All work must happen against Github tickets.
- Ticket you are working on should be assigned to you and in the “In Progress” column
- Only work on 1, or at most, 2 tickets at a time
- If you wish to work on a ticket outside your role consult the PM or Design Lead first
- If a ticket is taking a lot more work than you expected, reach out to the group
- The Lead for each role makes all final decisions about his area of focus
- Every ticket that is finished should result in a Git commit with the new assets
- Any team member may create a ticket for work they think is needed
- All tickets should have a Role label
- You may push directly to `master` or open a PR and merge, if you prefer
